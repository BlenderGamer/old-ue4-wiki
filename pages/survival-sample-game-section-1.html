       Binding functions to Key/Mouse input is a fairly simple two-step process. First you bind a string such as "MoveForward" to a function as shown below. The second step is to map this string of "MoveForward" to a key or mouse event by going to
       <em>
        Edit &gt; Project Settings &gt; Input.
       </em>
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <strong>
         BindAction()
        </strong>
        - Provides a trigger to call events like Jump or Throw. You may specify when you wish to run the function in the second parameter.
       </li>
       <li>
        <strong>
         BindAxis()
        </strong>
        - Useful for Movement and mouse input. The function you bind to this takes a single float as input. For example to move forward with W (1.0) or backward with S (-1.0), these values are manually specified in your project settings
        <em>
         Edit &gt; Project Settings &gt; Input

        Exposing functions and properties to Blueprint.
       </span>
      </h2>
      <p>
       Unreal Engine 4 supports several C++ Macros that allow you to expose properties and functions to Blueprint. This is very valuable for designers to extend C++ classes with Blueprint behavior and to rapidly tweak or overwrite values for multiple different child Blueprints. The same C++ Macros are used for replication (Networking), serialization (load/save games) etc. Replication is covered in later parts of this section.
      </p>

      </p>
      <pre class="lang:default decode:true">/* UPROPERTY is a Macro that exposes this variable to Unreal’s reflection system, this is how the editor knows how to deal with/visualize this value and to show or hide it as a tweakable value. It has several other purposes too which we will dig into later (such as replication) It is not required on every variable, only when you wish to apply special logic on it like exposing it to Blueprint. */

/* UFUNCTION follows the same theory, but is specialized to functions. In this case we expose the function to Blueprint and place it under “PlayerCondition” context menus of the editor.

UFUNCTION(BlueprintCallable, Category = "PlayerCondition")
float GetMaxHealth() const;</pre>
      <p>
       Even if you expose a property to Blueprint it’s recommended to assign sensible default values in the constructor so a designer can immediately start tweaking when creating a child Blueprint based on the C++ parent.

        Performing Ray-traces

      </h2>
      <p>
       Performing ray-traces is one way to finding objects in your scene, if you’re new to physics and/or collision in Unreal Engine 4 check out the
       <a class="external text" href="https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Engine/Physics/Collision/index.html" rel="nofollow">
        Collision Responses
       </a>
       page for info on Collision channels, responses and a few common interaction samples.
      </p>
      <p>
       This section we only use ray-tracing (or line tracing) to retrieve the object the player crosshair is currently looking at. In later sections we will perform line-traces to handle weapon damage and use physics material response to determine damage and particle effect responses.
      </p>
      <p>
       Performing a line trace is very simple, you need a start, end and length. Another important parameter to be aware of is the collision-channel. In the example below we use
       <em>
        ECC_Visibility
       </em>
       , any object that does not interact with this channel will let the ray pass through uninterrupted.
      </p>
      <p>
       Using bTraceComplex ensures we won’t collide with any rough blockers that are used for player motion and that we instead use per-triangle collision checks. Using this is more expensive, but required to avoid frustration of small invisible collision pieces sticking out of nearby objects that interrupt the ray.

       A third person camera requires some additional setup compared to a first-person viewpoint, but it’s still very quick and easy to do.

}</pre>
      <p>
       And don’t forget to include the correct header!

      </h2>
      <p>
       Timers can be very useful in many different gameplay scenarios. In the example we use it for the fuze of the pirate bomb. When the player interacts with the object, the fuze is activated (sound plays and particles start fizzing) and a timer is set as seen below.
      </p>
      <pre class="lang:c++ decode:true">void ASBombActor::OnUsed(APawn* InstigatorPawn)
{
    Super::OnUsed(InstigatorPawn);

    if (!bIsFuzeActive)
    {
        // This will trigger the ActivateFuze() on the clients
        bIsFuzeActive = true;

        // Repnotify does not trigger on the server, so call the function here directly.
        SimulateFuzeFX();

        // Active the fuze to explode the bomb after several seconds
        FTimerHandle TimerHandle;
        GetWorld()-&gt;GetTimerManager().SetTimer(TimerHandle, this, &amp;ASBombActor::OnExplode, MaxFuzeTime, false);
    }
}</pre>
      <p>
       After
       <em>
        MaxFuzeTime
       </em>
       elapses, OnExplode() is called. Since we pass “false” as the final parameter the timer does NOT repeat.

        Networking Intro
       </a>
       video on YouTube that explains some additional basics of the server-client pattern.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are using replication in your own project make sure you add...
      </p>
      <pre class="lang:default decode:true">#include "Net/UnrealNetwork.h"</pre>
      <p>
       ...to your YourProjectName.h file (eg. SurvivalGame.h) in Visual Studio. Otherwise you do not have access to the required macros for replication (such as DOREPLIFETIME(...))
      </p>
      <p>
       A nice “trick” with YourProjectName.h is that any header you include is now available to all class files in the project, but don’t go around adding all your custom classes to this file! It will only increase your compilation times.
      </p>
      <p>
       A general rule in networking is to Never trust the client. All gameplay runs on the server. This means that updating a variable, should be done on the server. Input is triggered on the client, yet we change the value on the server before the other clients will receive this change.
      </p>
      <p>
       Using Targeting (or Aiming Down Sights) as an example:
      </p>
      <pre class="lang:c++ decode:true">/* “Transient” is related to serialization, we only care about the “Replicated” designation for this section. Do remember to always include your variables inside the GetLifetimeReplicatedProps() function or they will not replicate to clients. (as shown below) */
UPROPERTY(Transient, Replicated)
bool bIsTargeting;</pre>
      <p>
       A very common convention from earlier versions of the engine is to prefix server-side functions with “Server” and explicit client-side functions with “Client”. A function without either one specified in the UFUNCTION macro should not use either prefixes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now any client should call SetTargeting(), inside the function we check if we are authoritative (Role == ROLE_Authority) if that check fails, we push the request to the server function which is ServerSetTargeting().
      </p>
      <pre class="lang:c++ decode:true">void SetTargeting(bool NewTargeting);

UFUNCTION(Server, Reliable, WithValidation)
void ServerSetTargeting(bool NewTargeting);</pre>
      <p>
       There are a few things to know about when dealing with server functions. In your class (cpp) file there is no function that is called ServerSetTargeting(), instead you have ServerSetTargeting_Implementation() and ServerSetTargeting_Validate(). In most cases, your _Implementation should only call the original function, since it is now executed on the server the Role check will pass. and the variables get updated and later replicated back to all clients.
      </p>
      <p>
       As you can see in the first function, we directly set the variable regardless of Role. This is possible because we used the COND_SkipOwner, replication condition on this variable inside the GetLifetimeReplicatedProps() function (see 2nd example below). With this special replication condition the value is never send back to us, so we have to set it locally anyway.
      </p>
      <pre class="lang:c++ decode:true">void ASCharacter::SetTargeting(bool NewTargeting)
{
    bIsTargeting = NewTargeting;

    if (Role &lt; ROLE_Authority)
    {
        ServerSetTargeting(NewTargeting);
    }
}

void ASCharacter::ServerSetTargeting_Implementation(bool NewTargeting)
{
    SetTargeting(NewTargeting);
}

bool ASCharacter::ServerSetTargeting_Validate(bool NewTargeting)
{
    return true;
}</pre>
      <p>
       If you browse to
       <a class="external text" href="https://github.com/tomlooman/EpicSurvivalGameSeries/blob/master/SurvivalGame/Source/SurvivalGame/Private/SCharacter.cpp" rel="nofollow">
        Character.cpp
       </a>
       you will notice a function like:
      </p>
      <pre class="lang:c++ decode:true">void ASCharacter::GetLifetimeReplicatedProps(TArray&lt;FLifetimeProperty&gt;&amp; OutLifetimeProps) const
{
    Super::GetLifetimeReplicatedProps(OutLifetimeProps);

    // Value is already updated locally, so we may skip it in replication step for the owner only (1 client)
    DOREPLIFETIME_CONDITION(ASCharacter, bWantsToRun, COND_SkipOwner);
    DOREPLIFETIME_CONDITION(ASCharacter, bIsTargeting, COND_SkipOwner);
    DOREPLIFETIME_CONDITION(ASCharacter, bIsJumping, COND_SkipOwner);

    // Replicate to every client, no special condition required
    DOREPLIFETIME(ASCharacter, Health);
    DOREPLIFETIME(ASCharacter, Hunger);
}</pre>
      <p>
       There are two different replication methods being used here. The first (DOREPLIFETIME_CONDITION(...)) is an optimization, since we already set our value locally, we can skip the owning client of the object. We do want to replicate these values to all other clients (and server) because for example bIsTargeting is used to drive the animation of the characters that are controlled by the other players.
      </p>
      <p>
       DOREPLIFETIME(...) is the default way, it replicates the value to all clients with no special logic. Now at this stage of the project you might be wondering why we want to replicate this value to other clients (afterall, they do not SEE or NEED this value at this time? And you are correct, we could have used DOREPLIFETIME_CONDITION(..., …, COND_OwnerOnly) to reduce network load! But since we are looking ahead, I know I want to include this data into the HUD as healthbars for your “party members”.

      <h3>
       <span class="mw-headline" id="RepNotify">
        RepNotify
       </span>
      </h3>
      <p>
       RepNotify is another replication concept so that clients can immediately respond to changes in a variable by the server. Whenever a variable marked with UPROPERTY(...,  ReplicatedUsing=OnRep_YourFunction) is updated then “OnRep_YourFunction” gets called, OnRep_ is another standard prefix you should consider using when dealing with RepNotify in your own code.
      </p>
      <p>

        View SBombActor.cpp
       </a>
       for an example on RepNotify. The pirate bomb responds to
       <em>
        bIsFuzeActive
       </em>
       by activating the sound and particle FX through OnRep_FuzeActive(). A good convention to use when dealing with RepNotify is to split cosmetic features into functions with a "Simulate" prefix. That makes it easier to keep track of the gameplay critical data that must always run on the server, and the cosmetic that is played on clients and non-dedicated servers (eg. a player that acts as the host of the match) only.
