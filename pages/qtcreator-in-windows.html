       This tutorial will describe how to setup your project for use with Qt Creator.
Why would you want this?
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Visual Studio is really limited for non-free versions.
       </li>
       <li>
        Qt Creator is fast and lightweight.
       </li>
       <li>
        Qt Creator's intellisense works better out of the box.
       </li>
       <li>
        Qt Creator has a lot of refactoring options out of the box.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       At the end of this tutorial you will be able to do the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Build your project from Qt Creator
       </li>
       <li>
        Run your project from Qt Creator
       </li>
       <li>
        Debug your project from Qt Creator
       </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
       So for the sake of this tutorial, I'm going to go ahead and create a new project called "MyQtProject", which will be based on the C++ First Person template.
Once the project is done generating, navigate to where you saved your project, which would be in my case "Documents\Unreal Projects\MyQtProject".
      </p>
      <p>
       Now go to "Intermediate\ProjectFiles" and create 3 new files called "MyQtProject.pro", "defines.pri" and "includes.pri". Make sure it has no extra extension such as ".txt".
Now open "MyQtProject.pro" in your favorite text editor (NOT Qt Creator), which is in my case Notepad++.
Go ahead and copy paste this into your project file:
      </p>
      <div class="mw-highlight mw-content-ltr" dir="ltr">
       <pre><span></span><span class="nv">TEMPLATE</span> <span class="o">=</span> app

<span class="c1"># All the defines of your project will go in this file</span>

include<span class="o">(</span>defines.pri<span class="o">)</span>

<span class="c1"># Qt Creator will automatically add headers and source files if you add them via Qt Creator.</span>

<span class="c1"># All your generated includes will go in this file</span>

      <h3>
       <span class="mw-headline" id="Generating_defines.pri_and_includes.pri">
        Generating defines.pri and includes.pri
       </span>
      </h3>
      <p>
       Now here is where the editor with regular expressions comes handy (and will save you a lot of annoying work).
      </p>
      <p>
       Assuming you have the Visual Studio project files in place, if not you can generate by right clicking your ".uproject", open "MyQtProject.vcxproj" with your text editor (NOT Visual studio).
      </p>
      <h4>
       <span class="mw-headline" id="defines.pri">
        defines.pri
       </span>
      </h4>
      <p>
       Scroll all the way down and find "&lt;NMakePreprocessorDefinitions&gt;", now copy the contents from that line into "defines.pri" and you will end up with something similar to this:
      </p>
      <div class="mw-highlight mw-content-ltr" dir="ltr">
       <pre><span></span>$(NMakePreprocessorDefinitions);UE_GAME=1;IS_PROGRAM=0;UE_ROCKET=1;UNICODE;_UNICODE;__UNREAL__;IS_MONOLITHIC=1;WITH_ENGINE=1;WITH_UNREAL_DEVELOPER_TOOLS=0;WITH_COREUOBJECT=1;USE_STATS_WITHOUT_ENGINE=0;
</pre>
      </div>
      <p>
       I left a big part of the line out, but as you can see, we have a ridiculously long line, now we're going to convert it into a format Qt Creator can use.
      </p>
      <p>
       Open up the replace window of your text editor and in the "Find" field put in ";" (without quotes), in the "Replace" field put "\r\n" (also without quotes), click "Replace all" (or the equivalent of it) and 
now every define should be on a new line.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're not done yet, now put in the "Find" field "^" (again without quotes) and in the "Replace" field "DEFINES += "" (without the outer quotes, be sure to include the second last quote). And click "Replace all".
Now we're almost done, just one last step. In the "Find" field, input "$" and in the "Replace" field input a quote. Click "Replace all" and your lines should like this:
      </p>
      <div class="mw-highlight mw-content-ltr" dir="ltr">
       <pre><span></span><span class="nv">DEFINES</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="s2">"DEFINE_GOES_HERE"</span>
</pre>
      </div>
      <p>
       Now save the file and we're done here.
      </p>
      <h4>
       <span class="mw-headline" id="includes.pri">
        includes.pri
       </span>
      </h4>
      <p>
       Back in "MyQtProject.vcxproj" scroll all the way down to "&lt;NMakeIncludeSearchPath&gt;", again copy the contents from that line into "includes.pri".
      </p>
      <p>
       Again replace semicolons by newlines just as we did for "defines.pri".
      </p>
      <p>
       Now instead of prepending "DEFINES += "", we prepend "INCLUDEPATH += "".
      </p>
      <p>
       Now append the quote like we did for "defines.pri".
      </p>
      <p>
       Your lines should look like this (you obviously have a lot more lines):
      </p>
      <div class="mw-highlight mw-content-ltr" dir="ltr">
       <pre><span></span><span class="nv">INCLUDEPATH</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="s2">"</span><span class="k">$(</span>NMakeIncludeSearchPath<span class="k">)</span><span class="s2">"</span>

</pre>
      </div>
      <p>
       Now save the file and we're done here.
      </p>
      <h2>
       <span class="mw-headline" id="Setting_up_the_debugger_for_Qt_Creator">
        Setting up the debugger for Qt Creator
       </span>
      </h2>
      <p>
       Now we have successfully configured our project, we need to setup the debugger.
      </p>
      <p>
       Open up Qt Creator and go to Tools-&gt;Options-&gt;Build &amp; Run-&gt;Debuggers and click on "Add".
      </p>
      <p>
       Even though there should already be a CDB listed, it's the 32 bit version, we need the 64 bit version for it to work with our project.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unless you changed the default installation path, CDB should be in "C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\8.1\Debuggers\x64\".
      </p>
      <p>
       Select "cdb.exe" and click "Open", give it a name and click "Apply".
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, still in the options window, go to Debugger-&gt;CDB and check "Ignore first chance access violations".
      </p>
      <p>
       Now to go the tab "CDB Paths" and put the following in "Symbol Paths":
      </p>
      <div class="mw-highlight mw-content-ltr" dir="ltr">
       <pre><span></span>symsrv*symsrv.dll*C:\Users\MyUsernameHere\AppData\Local\Temp\symbolcache
cache*C:\Users\MyUsernameHere\Local\Temp\symbolcache
</pre>
      </div>
      <p>
       Replace "MyUsernameHere" with your username (go to "C:\Users\" to make sure it's correct).
      </p>
      <p>
       Now go to Build &amp; Run-&gt;Kits and click "Add".
      </p>
      <p>
       I named it "UE4", but you can name it whatever you want. Leave "File system name:" empty. As "Device type:" select "Desktop", as "Device" select "Local PC (default for desktop)".
      </p>
      <p>
       Leave "Sysroot:" empty. As "Compiler:" select "Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler 12.0 (amd64)". As "Debugger:" select the debugger we added before, I called it "CDB 64 bit".
      </p>
      <p>
       As "Qt version:" select "Qt 5.3 MSVC2013 OpenGL 64bit", your version might be different and you might not have the OpenGL version, but that doesn't matter as long as it's for "MSVC2013 64bit".
      </p>
      <p>
       Now click "Apply" to save our changes.
      </p>
      <p>
       NOTE: When starting to debug your project, it will ask if you want to use the Microsoft symbol servers, DO NOT USE THEM!!! It will slow down debugging to snail speed, having it turned on made just starting up the editor take about 5 minutes.

       Change "Tab Policy" to "Tabs Only", "Tab Size" to 4, "Indent Size" to 4 and "Align Continuation Lines" to "With Regular Indent".
      </p>
      <p>
       The rest is all personal preference on how your code is formatted, so be sure to go there if you don't like how something is formatted. But you have to use tabs as per policy of Epic, probably because some tools only work well with tabs is my guess.

        Configuring the project
       </span>
      </h2>
      <p>
       Ok, now that we are almost done, we need to configure a few other small things for building, running and debugging to work.
      </p>
      <p>
       Open the project file by clicking "Open Project" on the welcome page. The first time you open it you need to select a kit you want to use to compile, be sure to pick the kid we added before, in my case "UE4".
      </p>
      <p>
       Now that our project is loaded, it wont compile and run just yet. We need to configure Qt Creator to use UBT first.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the strip on the left size click on the folder icon with the text "Projects", here we can change the build settings.
      </p>
      <p>
       At "Edit build configuration:" click "Rename" and rename the "Debug" configuration to "Debug Editor".
      </p>
      <h3>
       <span class="mw-headline" id="Build">
        Build
       </span>
      </h3>
      <p>
       Now at "Build Steps" and "Clean Steps" remove all the entries. Now at "Build Steps", click "Add Build Step" and select "Custom Process Step".
      </p>
      <p>
       Now you can fill in a command, point this to the "Build.bat" of the engine version you're using, in my case it is "C:\Program Files\Unreal\Unreal Engine\4.4\Engine\Build\BatchFiles\Build.bat" (without quotes).
      </p>
      <p>
       As "Arguments:" fill in "MyQtProjectEditor Win64 DebugGame "C:\Users\MyUsernameHere\Documents\Unreal Projects\MyQtProject\MyQtProject.uproject" -rocket" (without quotes). Where "C:\Users\MyUsernameHere\Documents\Unreal Projects\MyQtProject\MyQtProject.uproject" is the path to your project file and "MyQtProjectEditor" needs to be changed to reflect the name of your project.
      </p>
      <p>
       As "Working directory:" set it to "C:\Users\MyUsernameHere\Documents\Unreal Projects\MyQtProject\Intermediate\Build" (without quotes).
      </p>
      <h3>
       <span class="mw-headline" id="Clean">
        Clean
       </span>
      </h3>
      <p>
       For the "Clean Steps" do the same, but point it "Clean.bat" instead, which is in the same folder as "Build.bat".
      </p>
      <h3>
       <span class="mw-headline" id="Run">
        Run
       </span>
      </h3>
      <p>
       Now under "Run" and then "Run configuration:", click "Add" and select "Custom Executable".
      </p>
      <p>
       Rename it to "Debug Editor" by clicking on "Rename...".
      </p>
      <p>
       For "Executable:" point it to the location of "UE4Editor.exe", which is in my case "C:\Program Files\Unreal\Unreal Engine\4.4\Engine\Binaries\Win64\UE4Editor.exe" (without quotes).
      </p>
      <p>
       As "Arguments:" fill in ""C:\Users\MyUsernameHere\Documents\Unreal Projects\MyQtProject\MyQtProject.uproject" -debug" (without the outer quotes).
      </p>
      <p>
       And as "Working directory:" set it to "C:\Users\MyUsernameHere\Documents\Unreal Projects\MyQtProject\Binaries\Win64" (without quotes). And uncheck "Run in terminal".
      </p>
      <p>
       The annoying part is that you have to change this every time you change the configuration, it doesn't change with the build configurations.

       We're now almost done, but here a few final guide lines.

      <p>
       To build the project you can either build from the menu or press Ctrl+B.
      </p>
      <p>
       To run the project you can either run it from the menu or press Ctrl+R.
      </p>
      <p>
       To debug you can either start debugging from the menu or press F5.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once you start debugging for the first time, Qt Creator will ask you if you want to use the Microsoft Symbol servers, DO NOT USE IT! It will make the debugging process painfully slow, with it turned on it will take about 5 minutes before the editor is opened and you can start debugging.
