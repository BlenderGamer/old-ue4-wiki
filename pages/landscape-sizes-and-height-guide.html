       This is an integration to basic documentation for Unreal Landscape tool. 
After reading this document, you'll be able to obtain the exact size and vertex/meter resolution you need for your landscape,
       <br/>
       edit it and get the height you need for your mountains and hills.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's get started!
       <br/>
      </p>
      <h2>
       <span class="mw-headline" id="Landscape_basics">

      </h2>
      <p>
       A landscape is a subdivided plane with a density of 1 vertex per meter.
       <br/>
       At Z Scale = 100 it has an height range limit of -256m:256.
       <br/>
       If you understand these basic rules, you can get any size at any resolution with height extensions needed.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <h2>
       <span class="mw-headline" id="Changing_your_size_and_height_extensions">
        Changing your size and height extensions
       </span>
      </h2>
      <p>
       If you need a 2km wide landscape, but you think that a resolution of 1 vertex/ 2 meters is more than enough,
       <br/>
       and you want your mountains/hills to be 512 m tall, you can go like this:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        create a new landscape with 1009x1009	resolution (as usual, refer to
        <a class="external text" href="https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Engine/Landscape/TechnicalGuide/index.html#recommendedlandscapesizes" rel="nofollow">
         Landscape recommended size
        </a>
        )
       </li>
       <li>
        set X scale to 200.
       </li>
       <li>
        now your landscape will be not centered anymore: if you want it to be in center of the scene, you must adjust x and y location. you doubled the size of the landscape, so now it has an extent of 1009*2 = 2018 m = 201800 cm(UE units) divide it by two (201800/2 = 100900) and insert them in x and y position of your Landscape actor with a MINUS sign.
       </li>
       <li>
        basic height extent is 256 at Z scale = 100, so to have it extended to 512, you must multiply Z scale by 2. So set Z scale = 200.
       </li>
       <li>
        edit your landscape freely
       </li>
      </ol>
