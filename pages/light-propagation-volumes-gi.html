      <p>
       Light propagation volumes is a technique to approximately achieve global illumination (GI) in Real-time.
       <br/>
       It uses lattices and spherical harmonics (SH) to represent the spatial and angular distribution of light in the scene.
      </p>
      <p>
       <br/>
      </p>
      <h2>
       <span class="mw-headline" id="How_to_enable_it">
        How to enable it
       </span>
      </h2>
      <p>
       The use of Light propagation volumes is disabled by default, since this feature is still under development by Epic.
       <br/>
       To enable this feature you need to edit the "ConsoleVariables.ini" file, which is located in your engine config folder. The default location for it is as follows
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       <code>
        C:\Program Files\Unreal Engine\4.0\Engine\Config\
       </code>
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       Now you have to add
       <i>
        r.LightPropagationVolume=1
       </i>
       at the bottom, right below the
       <i>
        [Startup]
       </i>
       category.
       <br/>
       Now your file should look like this:
       <br/>
      </p>
      <pre>; ConsoleVariables.ini
;
; This file allows to set console variables on engine startup (In undefined order).
; Console variables also can be set in engine ini files (e.g. BaseEngine.ini, DefaultEngine.ini) in the [SystemSettings] section.
; This file should be in the source control database (for the comments and to know where to find it)
; but kept empty from variables.
; A developer can change it locally to save time not having to type repetitive
; console variable settings. The variables need to be in the section called [Startup].
; Later on we might have multiple named sections referenced by the section name.
; This would allow platform specific or level specific overrides.
; The name comparison is not case sensitive and if the variable doesn't exists it's silently ignored.
;
; Example file content:
;
; [Startup]
; FogDensity = 0.9
; ImageGrain = 0.5
; FreezeAtPosition = 2819.5520 416.2633 75.1500 65378 -25879 0

[Startup]

; Uncomment to get detailed logs on shader compiles and the opportunity to retry on errors
;r.ShaderDevelopmentMode=1
r.LightPropagationVolume=1
</pre>
      <p>
       Now you have to start/restart your Editor.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       But before you can actually use this feature you need to change some settings inside the Editor.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <div class="floatleft">
       <img alt="DirLight.png" class="" height="42" src="../assets/light-propagation-volumes-gi/0.png" width="42"/>
      </div>
      First of all you have to place a "
      <i>
       Directional Light
      </i>
      " in your scene.
      <br/>
      <p>
       By either clicking with your right mouse button in the viewport and selecting "
       <i>
        Place Actor - Directional Light
       </i>
       " or by dragging it from the left "
       <i>
        Modes
       </i>
       " tab into your scene.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       As next you need to go into the properties of your newly created Light. You now need to check the "
       <i>
        Affect Dynamic Indirect Lighting
       </i>
       " option in order to activate the use of LPV.
       <br/>
       In case you don't see this option, make sure that the "
       <i>
        Show All Advanced Details
       </i>
       " option is checked inside the Details panel. You can find this option under the little
       <i>
        Eye icon
       </i>
       <img alt="Eye-ico.gif" class="" height="22" src="../assets/light-propagation-volumes-gi/1.gif" width="36"/>
       right next to the search bar.
       <br/>
       As next scroll down to the "
       <i>
        Cascaded Shadow Maps
       </i>
       " category and increase the value of "
       <i>
        Dynamic Shadow Distance StationaryLight
       </i>
       " (Dynamic Shadow Distance Movable if it is a Movable light) to 10.000.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       Now you have to disable the use of Lightmass, by going into your World Settings.
       <img alt="WorldSet.gif" class="" height="20" src="../assets/light-propagation-volumes-gi/2.gif" width="20"/>
       <br/>
       In here you have to look for an option called "
       <i>
        Force No Precomputed Lighting
       </i>
       " which is located under the Lightmass category, check the checkbox to disable the use of Lightmass. Now you can close the World Settings tab or window.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       Once this is done you actually need to re/build your lighting to invalidate and delete all previous existing baked data.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       Congratulations, now you have global illumination in real-time.
      </p>

        Tweaking
       </span>
      </h2>
      <p>
       No matter that this feature is actually under development, there are already some option for you to tweak.
       <br/>
       To get these options you have to place a "
       <i>
        PostProcessVolume
       </i>
       " in your scene. Once again simple drag &amp; drop a "
       <i>
        PostProcessVolume
       </i>
       " from the "
       <i>
        Volumes
       </i>
       " list under the "Modes" tab into your scene.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       Now in its properties scroll all the way down to the "
       <i>
        PostProcessVolume
       </i>
       " category and check the "
       <i>
        Unbound
       </i>
       " checkbox. This will make sure that your PP is used in the whole level and not just inside its boundaries.
       <br/>
       Now scroll up until you see the "Light Propagation Volume" category and expand it.
       <br/>

       Thats it, folks! You probably have to play around with these settings a bit to get proper results out of it.
       <br/>
       But it's a start.
