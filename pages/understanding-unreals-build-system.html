       It can be initially confusing when presented with the different solution configurations or build options in Visual Studio. This is a compiled list detailing how the overall build systems seems to work and what you need to know as a developer.

       To start things off you can find your builds in the Binaries folder of your Project Directory. Anytime you launch the Editor you need to have a compiled version of your project to run against. This is
       <i>

       your

       but not limited to. Which brings us to the topic of Configurations:

      <p>
       When the UE4Editor.exe is loaded it attaches to the Development Editor [UE4Editor-YourGame.dll]. If this .dll is not present it will offer to build it. Once the editor is loaded you can update it by recompiling from Visual Studio as a Development Editor build. You can also recompile from Visual Studio as a DebugGame Editor build [UE4Editor-YourGame-Win64-DebugGame.dll].
      </p>
      <p>
       It's worth noting before moving on, that if you shut down the editor and reload it will use the last good Development Editor build. So if you were using DebugGame Editor builds it may look like you lost work. Simply rebuild the DebugGame Editor and it will hot load into the editor.
      </p>

       When using a standalone build you drop the overhead of the UE4Editor and just run the game. This must be done with COOKED content created from the editor. Simply go to
       <b>
        File &gt; Cook Content for [Platform]
       </b>
       . This will create cooked content in your game in project local directory
       <b>
        ..\Saved\Cooked\WindowsNoEditor
       </b>
       .
      </p>

       Either listed build type can be used when launching the your game from command line. using switch "-game" will launch your game using [UE4Editor-YourGame.dll]. And using switches "-game -debug" will launch your game using [UE4Editor-YourGame-Win64-DebugGame.dll].

      <p>
       The editor contains a Compile button on the main shelf. When this button is pushed, the unreal build tools create a new Development Editor build and hot links it back to the editor.
