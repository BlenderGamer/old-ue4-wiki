      <p>
       You need to download the pre-built toolchain first, since it contains the necesary scripts (see toolchain/Build/script/ directory). You may also want to follow the steps in its Build/script/README.md rather than here, since they may match the scripts you have better.
      </p>
      <p>
       Copy BuildCrossToolchain.sh together with linux-host.config and win64-host.config to a Linux machine running reasonably recent distro. Make sure that the following pre-requisites are installed (using Debian package names here):
      </p>
      <pre>mercurial autoconf gperf bison flex libtool libtool-bin ncurses-dev texinfo gawk
</pre>
      <p>
       and of course make/gcc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Run the script, which will clone current crosstool-ng and will use it to perform so called "Canadian cross", i.e. will build Linux-hosted toolchain which targets mingw64 first, and then will build Windows-hosted toolchain that targets Linux. Note that the choice of kernel and binutils is pretty conservative and you are free to experiment (using "ct-ng menuconfig") if you need more recent ones. Not every combination is buildable though.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the script finishes without error, the new toolchain will be copied to subfolder called CrossToolchain of the current folder. Copy it to your Windows machine, e.g. to C:\CrossToolchain. Note that libz.a from this folder will be copied to lib64 folder of the toolchain.

      <p>
       You can grab a pre-built clang from
       <a class="external text" href="http://llvm.org/releases/download.html" rel="nofollow">
        here
       </a>
       , but we haven't actually tried that, building ourselves for various reasons. Detailed instructions how to build clang are given here:
       <a class="external free" href="http://clang.llvm.org/get_started.html" rel="nofollow">
        http://clang.llvm.org/get_started.html
       </a>
       To recap, you will need: cmake, python and a supported compiler (recent Visual Studio is Ok).
      </p>
      <p>
       Grab stable releases of llvm and clang from here:
       <a class="external free" href="http://llvm.org/releases/download.html#3.3" rel="nofollow">
        http://llvm.org/releases/download.html#3.3
       </a>
       and unpack it to your local folder (unpack llvm first, then unpack clang into llvm/tools subdirectory).Use cmake to generate project files and then build Release (or MinSizeRel) x64 configuration of "install" (or INSTALL, if you are using Visual Studio) target. Copy
      </p>
      <pre>bin/clang++.exe
lib/clang/3.3/include 
</pre>
      <p>
       into the toolchain (so their relative path from toolchain root stays the same). At this point you should be done and your toolchain should be usable for
       .
