       When opening some of Epic's sample projects, you'll notice that not all of them come with Visual Studio projects.
      </p>
      <p>
       What if you want to peek behind the code though, and add some of your own? Well fortunately Unreal Engine 4 can do that for you.
      </p>
      <h3>
       <span class="mw-headline" id="Creating_the_sample_project">
        Creating the sample project

      </h3>
      <p>
       Let's use the
       <b>
        Strategy Game
       </b>
       sample in this instance. Download the sample from the main menu which appears when you launch UE4.
      </p>
      <p>
       Open the project, then in windows explorer, browse to the location of your new Strategy Game. In my case, the path is:
       <i>
        C:\Users\HomeDesktop\Documents\Unreal Projects\StrategyGame
       </i>
      </p>
      <h3>
       <span class="mw-headline" id="Generate_the_VS_project">
        Generate the VS project
       </span>
      </h3>
      <p>
       You'll see round blue icon, with the white letter "U", representing thee Unreal Engine, inside that folder. The type should read "
       <b>
        Unreal Engine Project File."
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Right-click on that icon, then left-click when the text appears which reads:
       <b>
        "Generate Visual Studio Files"
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The command line prompt will appear, and it will begin to generate a VS project for you. Just above your Strategy Game project, you should see a new file for Visual Studio. Open it up to take a peek at all of the C++ code behind your game!
