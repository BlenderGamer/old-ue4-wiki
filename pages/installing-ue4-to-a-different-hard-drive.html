       This is a simple guide for people who would like to move Unreal Engine 4 to a different directory (After installing it before). For example, if you were to install Unreal Engine 4 on C:/ and then later down the line you purchased another Hard Disk Drive and plug it into your PC. Now, you're running out of space on C:/ and want to move it to another directory.

        BEFORE WE START. MAKE SURE THE LAUNCHER AND UNREAL ENGINE 4 EDITOR ARE NOT RUNNING.

       Sidenote: The directory where the unreal engine is installed may be different depending on your launcher/engine version. It may be under C:\Program Files\Epic Games\VersionNumber or under C:\Program Files\Unreal\VersionNumber.
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Create the folder where you want to move Unreal Engine to. In this case "D:\Unreal" is used
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Cut all the directories under the folder where Unreal Engine is installed and paste them to your desired location.
      </p>
      <p>
       3)Make a link for each directory you moved:
For example, if your install location is "C:\Program Files\Epic Games\" and you want to link a directory named 4.8 to "D:\Unreal\4.8", you would open a command prompt (Windows Key + R, then type "cmd" , then press Enter Key) and type:
      </p>
      <p>
       <code>
        cd "C:\Program Files\Epic Games\"
       </code>
      </p>
      <p>
       <code>
        mklink /j 4.8 D:\Unreal\4.8
       </code>
      </p>
      <p>
       You also need to make a link for the other Engine versions as well as the Launcher and DirectXRedist folder.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        You have now successfully moved whole Unreal Engine to a different folder.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       P.S. The same concept applies to linux and mac machines. The link command is just different.

       You may encounter various errors if you tried using the exact same syntax to use the previous commands, for example:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        "cd" doesn't make you change directory, you may use "cd /d" instead.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <pre><b>&gt;</b> Solution regarding this tutorial: <br/><b>Here, you do not need to use "cd" or "cd /d" anymore.</b>
</pre>
      <ul>
       <li>
        using "mklink" you get the following error:
        <i>
         "The syntax of the command is incorrect."
        </i>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <pre><b>&gt;</b> Solution regarding this tutorial: <br/><b>Try using the following commands which are a bit different.</b>
</pre>
      <p>
       <code>
        mklink /J " **Original Directory** " " **New Directory** "
       </code>
      </p>
      <p>
       You need to add quotes
       <b>
        ""
       </b>
       , then you'll get something like this (version number may vary):
      </p>
      <p>
       <code>
        mklink /J "D:\Program Files\Epic Games\4.9" "E:\Program Files\Epic Games\4.9"
       </code>
      </p>
      <p>
       If the junction link has been successfully created, you'll get something like this (again, version number may vary):
      </p>
      <p>
       <code>
        Junction created for D:\Program Files\Epic Games\4.9 &lt;&lt;===&gt;&gt; E:\Program Files\Epic Games\4.9
       </code>
      </p>
      <p>
       <br/>
       <b>
        Don't forget to do this for the "DirectXRedist" as well as the "Launcher" folder and everything should work correctly.
