      <p>
       This guide is being created to help troubleshoot problems that the Unreal Engine is currently having in regards to running on CentOS 7, for those people looking to have official tech support when running professional applications from Autodesk such as Maya. CentOS 7 is the best option, while not currently offically supported yet by Autodesk, Autodesk does have a long history of only providing support for the RedHat distro and recently CentOS. I'd also like to note that this guide is not an official document from Epic on running the Unreal Engine 4 on CentOS 7, but a user created guide to attempt to help this application succeed on Linux in general.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also I'd also like to note -- not all computers are going to be able to run Unreal 4 as a game or editor. Even if you can install Centos 7 x64 on your computer, that doesn't mean your hardware will be power enough to run Unreal 4.
      </p>

       Installed CentOS 7 and only worried about the installation and formatting of the main system drive. The system was installed as a "Development and Creative Workstation" and included the following package groups were checked from the menu on the right side.

       Note - The user that was created during the install process was also made an administrator by checking the box.

       Now that the system has been updated it's time to add the additional repos EPEL, Nux-Desktop and Mono-Project. For those that don't know, a Repository is another source of linux packages designed for a specific distro. This allows you as a user to install software that doesn't offically come from CentOS or Redhat without having to build the software from source code. Offical repos come added to a system when you install to do thinks like provide updates. Extra Packages Enterprise Linux (EPEL) adds some additional packages that aren't included in CentOS 7 and have been tested by the Fedora Community for RedHat 7, such as mono and clang. The Nux-Desktop repo aims to bring better multimedia packages to Enterprise Linux includes programs such as Steam, vlc and other multimedia software that you'll find useful when working with the Unreal Engine 4, such as HandBrake to better encode videos produced by Unreal's Matinee. These repos work well together and trying to not overwrite the base CentOS 7 packages.  This means that your software won't break because of library incompatiablities.
      </p>
      <pre>$ sudo yum install epel-release 
$ sudo rpm -Uvh <a class="external free" href="http://li.nux.ro/download/nux/dextop/el7/x86_64/nux-dextop-release-0-1.el7.nux.noarch.rpm" rel="nofollow">http://li.nux.ro/download/nux/dextop/el7/x86_64/nux-dextop-release-0-1.el7.nux.noarch.rpm</a>

       mesa-libGLU was installed because it is needed if you intend to use Blender. libXScrnSaver was needed by the Unreal Editor. **this could be due to my system having an issue with the some centos updates**

       Now it's time to install your video card, the open source video card drivers may work alright but often times better to get the closed source Nvidia and Radeon drivers, especially if you are using professional applications such as Autodesk Maya.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please note that while some repos provide these graphics drivers in packages for CentOS 7, these repos may overwrite packages provided by RedHat, CentOS and Fedora and can effect the stablity of your system. Meaning - you may want to look at how to install the drivers by making a package for your system directly from the installers provided by Nvidia or AMD. This may mean you need to re-install the driver with every kernel update as well.

       Created a directory to save the clean branch in my home Directory.

       note - on a clean install A dialog box popped up to input your github username and password because the Unreal Engine repo on github is private.

       Getting Dependencies - if you are trying to go with what RedHat, Centos and Fedora provide to keep it simple and stable, which installs mono 2.10.8 and clang/llvm 3.4.2, Unreal Engine will not build for you. Both package versions are known to have some problems on Mac and other Linux distros. With the Additional repo from JKnife that I talked about earlier in the guide you can run the following to install what is needed to build Unreal Engine 4. (These commands also work if you've installed the official mono-project repo like I have)
      </p>
      <pre>$ sudo yum install mono-core mono-devel dos2unix cmake gtk3-devel clang
</pre>
      <p>
       note - mono, gtk3-devel and clang all install additional dependencies.
      </p>

       Next you have to generate your Oauth token on github's site.
      </p>
      <pre><a class="external free" href="https://github.com/settings/tokens/new" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/settings/tokens/new</a>
</pre>
      <p>
       Then export your Oauth key with the following command
      </p>
      <pre>$ export OAUTH_TOKEN=YourLongStringOfNumbersHere
$ cd
$ cd UnrealEngine
$ ./Setup.sh
</pre>
      <p>
       Now we can generate the make files in order to start building Unreal Engine 4.
      </p>
      <pre>$ ./GenerateProjectFiles.sh
</pre>
      <p>
       It should now run and update the dependency files you need if they are out of date.

       Since we're already in the correct directory, the follow command should be the last step in order to have the editor build in CentOS 7.
      </p>
      <pre>$ make 
</pre>
      <p>
       This could take a while depending on your machine. On an AMD FX 4150, I walk my dog, get some food, maybe watch a tv show and come back.

       This step is one of the easiest steps but it's important to see what is working and what isn't working currently with Unreal Engine 4 on the linux platform.
      </p>
      <pre>$ cd Engine/Binaries/Linux
$ ./UE4Editor

       I still hope this helps people, and improves the Unreal Engine 4 Linux experience.
