       Eximius provides a multi-role gameplay experience where each player could choose to play a diversely different role and fight not only with brawns but also with their brains. An expert shooter could be outnumbered, ambushed and overwhelmed if caught in a wrong position. While a scheming officer could be assassinated in the right moment at the frontlines.

      </p>
      <p>
       While the game is primarily focused on Player vs Player multiplayer experience, purely co-op game modes(PvE) will be launched as part of the game in later stages as episodic missions to explore the rich lore of the game

      <p>
       The objective of the gameplay is to win by holding down the most victory points. Alternatively, if your forces are powerful enough, you can completely destroy your enemy’s base and win the match immediately. The command headquarters cannot be rebuilt and the game will be instantly over.

       As a commander you are also an officer, but you have the extra capability to switch to top down RTS interface to build bases and command units. An aggressive commander can also join the battle in the frontlines but they are normally expected to stay in relative safety and manage base development. Commander needs to be nominated by the team.

       As the gameplay of Eximius revolves around team versus team battles, each team shares a base as well as resources and technology tree. RTS Commander can support the battle operations by training infantry units and vehicles, building bases and calling in airstrikes or support abilities.
