       First, add a
       <b>
        WaterSettings
       </b>
       Blueprint to your level. This Blueprint manages the database of wave spectra and automatically writes the material parameters to the water material. You always need exactly one WaterSettings Blueprint in your level.
      </p>
      <p>
       Next, add one or multiple
       <b>
        WaterPlane
       </b>
       Blueprints. You now have a working water surface! If you started with the default empty level, you should also add a SkyLight and a
       <b>
        PostProcessVolume
       </b>
       with FXAA enabled and Unbound set to true.  If you are using 4.14 or higher, you need to manually select FXAA under
       <b>

      <p>
       By default, the sea state is set to a

        Wind Speed

        <b>
         Fetch Length
        </b>
       </a>

       If the

        Follow Camera
       </b>
       option in the WaterPlane Blueprint Details panel is set to true, the WaterPlane is automatically translated and scaled to create the impression of an infinite ocean. If you are creating a lake it's better to turn this option off and to create a custom water plane mesh with exactly the right size. If you enable this option, it's a good idea to check in Wireframe view mode if the automated scaling of the water plane works as intended.

      <p>
       The look of the water surface is heavily influenced by the surroundings, be it a sky sphere for an infinite ocean or the adjacent landscape of a lake. This is particularly true if you have a very reflective water material. In most of my demo videos there ist just a sky sphere and no other surrounding geometry, so I enabled the foam texture and the detail normal map to make the water surface look more interesting. A different approach is to make the water surface more reflective and to add

        Reflection Capture Actors
       </a>
       and have the look of the water be dominated by reflections. A good example for this water look is the Vehicle Game example from Epic (see also the tutorial below).

      <p>
       To get started with lighting, check out the demo Maps that are included. Here's the basic lighting setup that is used:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Use the
        <b>
         Sky Sphere
        </b>
        and
        <b>
         Light Source
        </b>
        from the Default empty map.
       </li>
       <li>
        Change the Sun Brightness and the rotation of the directional Light Source to your liking.
       </li>
       <li>
        Add a
        <b>
         Sky Light
        </b>
        with Source Type
        <b>
         SLS Captured Scene
        </b>
        . This will light the water surface and the floating objects from all directions.
       </li>
       <li>
        Add a
        <b>
         Lightmass Importance Volume
        </b>
        and scale it up, for example by factor 50. In the Viewport, use the
        <b>
         Show
        </b>
        →
        <b>
         Vizualize

        →
        <b>
         Volume Lighting Samples
        </b>
        option to make sure you have more than one sample in the volume. Lighting Samples usually are created in great number only above static surfaces, but the water surface is set to movable because of the Infinite Ocean System. When we make the Lightmass Importance Volume large enough, the engine will create some Lighting Samples scattered in the Volume. These are enough to light objects that are floating on the surface, even outside the bounds of the Volume.

      <p>
       In
       <b>
        SinglePoint Mode
       </b>
       , the floating object will be fixed to a single point on the water surface. The translation and rotation of the object are directly taken from the output of the Gerstner equations, so all the other settings on the Buyancy Component have no effect. As a result, the object will just move with the water surface and rotate according to the local normal vector of the point on the water surface where it is located. This buoyancy mode is relatively cheap to calculate because the Gerstner equations need only to be evaluated at one point for each tick. However, the motion of the object will only be realistic for small objects, for example leaves or rubber ducks floating on the surface. For large objects like boats, you should use AutoPoints mode.
      </p>

        Physics Simulation
       </a>
       is performed. The buyant force on a number of points on the object is calculated and applied. The magnitude of the buoyant force depends on the depth of immersion of each point. The counteracting force is gravity that is automatically applied by the engine. The Buoyancy Component will automatically generate the coordinates for the points in
       <b>
        rectangular
       </b>
       or
       <b>
        elliptical
       </b>
       shape, taking into account the dimensions of the object. With the N

       and
       <b>
        N Points Y

       you can control the number of points that are generated. In elliptical mode,
       <b>
        N Points X
       </b>
       is the number of points in radial direction and
       <b>
        N Points Y
       </b>
       is the number of points in tangential direction. The buoyant force is scaled so that at a certain depth of immersion, an equilibrium exists. You can change how deep an object is submerged with the
       <b>
        Float Factor
       </b>
       parameter.

         Buoyant Force Debug Visualization on a Boat

      </div>
      <p>
       To check the location of the calculated points, you can enable the
       <b>
        Draw Debug
       </b>
       option. In this mode, a small sphere is drawn at the coordinates of each points, and the length of the vertical arrows is proportional to the buoyant force. Use this mode to make sure that the number and shape of the generated points is as intended.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you set up Buoyancy for large objects that need to move in a certain way, you will probably need to tweak the parameters a bit to get the desired result. As an example, have a look at the parameters used for the boat in the DemoMap. With the
       <b>
        PointsScale
       </b>
       parameter (by default set to 0.8) you can scale the coordinates of the generated points inwards so that no points are located directly at the bounds of the object. This is usually desirable.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the cubes, we have generated only four points. With PointsScale set to 1, these four points would be located exactly at the corners of the cube. This way, the buoyant force that exists at the center of the cube would be neglected completely. By scaling the points inwards a bit, we move them closer to the center. The hull of boats is usually bent, and with
       <b>
        PointsScale
       </b>
       set to 1 the outmost generated points would end up outside of the hull, where no buoyant force exists. It may also be necessary to adjust the
       <b>
        Linear Damping
       </b>
       and
       <b>

       parameters, especially of you're dealing with very large or very small objects.

       To trigger a sea state transition, call the
       <b>
        ChangeSeaState
       </b>
       function of the WaterSettings Blueprint. The input arguments are:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        New Wind Speed (in m/s)
       </li>
       <li>
        New Fetch Length (in km)
       </li>
       <li>
        New Wind Direction (in degrees)
       </li>
       <li>
        Transition Time (in seconds)
       </li>
       <li>
        Transition Quality
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       If the new values for wind speed and fetch length are very different, it is advisable to to get there with multiple small steps, meaning multiple consecutive calls to the
       <b>
        ChangeSeaState
       </b>
       function that each change the sea state just a bit. This way the transition will look more natural because the algorithm only needs to figure out a good transition for values that are not too different.
      </p>
      <p>
       The minimum
       <b>
        TransitionTime
       </b>
       that should be used depends on how much wind speed and fetch length are changing. As you can see in the video above, in some cases 10 seconds are enough to get a nice-looking transition. However if you can, you should use higher values to make the transition look more natural. If you change the Wind Direction by a large amount, make sure that the Transition Time is long enough.
      </p>
      <p>
       With Update 4 of Physical Water Surface, the performance of sea state transitions was improved. If you need to improve the performance further, you can select a lower
       <b>
        Transition Quality
       </b>
       . If you use a lower quality setting, the transition calculation will run at a lower frame rate than the game. When using a lower quality, you might see a judder in the water motion during the transition.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to delay execution of the subsequent code until the transition has finished, add a delay node after the Change Sea State node.

       If no special measures are taken, water will also appear inside of boats. The water material of Physical Water Surface is set to Blend Mode
       <i>
        Masked
       </i>
       , and is already prepared in such a way that water
       <b>
        can be easily masked inside of floating objects
       </b>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       This method makes use of
       <a class="external text" href="https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/Engine/Rendering/LightingAndShadows/MeshDistanceFields" rel="nofollow">
        Mesh Distance Fields
       </a>
       . Specifically, we use the the fact that the DistanceToNearestSurface material node returns a negative distance inside of a mesh. The water material detects this and masks the water accordingly.  To see this effect in action, have a look at the Map
       <b>
        MaskedWater
       </b>
       that comes with Physical Water Surface. After enabling Mesh Distance Fields, you should see that the water inside the boat disappears. The image on the left shows how the effect looks like.
      </p>
      <p>
       To make use of Mesh Distance Fields, you need to enable the option "Generate Mesh Distance Fields" the Project Settings first. See

        Here is a step by step guide how to mask out water inside of boats:
       </big>
      </p>
      <p>
       1. Enable
       <b>
        Generate Mesh Distance Fields
       </b>
       in the Project Settings, then restart the Editor.
      </p>
      <p>
       2. You need to
       <b>
        create another mesh
       </b>
       that has the same size as the boat, but that is
       <i>
        not
       </i>
       hollow. This mesh will be used to generate the Mesh Distance Fields. The image below shows the example meshes that come with Physical Water Surface. The boat on the left is not hollow,
       <b>
        all water inside this mesh will be masked
       </b>
       . The mesh on the right is the one that will be visible.
      </p>

      </div>
      <p>
       <br/>
       3. In the Details Panel of the original boat mesh, choose the boat mesh that is
       <i>
        not
       </i>
       hollow as
       <b>

       . The image below shows the setup.

      </div>
      <p>
       <br/>
       4. Make sure that
       <b>
        Affect Distance Field Lighting
       </b>
       is enabled on the boat. You can disable this option on all other StaticMeshes to improve performance.

       </div>
      </div>
      <p>
       5. Use the
       <b>
        Show → Visualize → Mesh Distance Fields
       </b>
       option in the Viewport to check that the boat does not appear to be hollow. The image on the right shows how the Mesh Distance Fields should look like.
      </p>
      <p>
       After completing these steps, the water inside of the boat will be masked out automatically by the water material.
      </p>
      <p>
       In some cases it is possible that some water is still visible inside the boat, especially if the hull of the boat is very thin. This happens when the resolution of the Global Distance Field is not fine enough to capture the hull of the ship accurately. If you have this problem, you can try to use the console command r.AOGlobalDFResolution to increase the Global Distance Field Resolution (

        Network Replication
       </span>
      </h3>
      <p>
       This section provides a guideline how to implement Network Replication with Physical Water Surface. The water material already comes with a Material Parameter
       <b>
        TimeOffset
       </b>
       which is needed for Network Replication of the water motion. Several users of Physical Water Surface have successfully used Network Replication in their projects.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Wave Parameters
       </b>
       are material parameters that are written to a Material Parameter Collection, and are read by the water material. These parameters are constant (unless a sea state transition is going on), so normally they are just written once to the Material Parameter Collection On Begin Play.
      </p>
      <p>
       The state of the water motion (World Position Offset of the water material) depends on the Wave Parameters and on the time. To be precise, on the time output of the
       <b>
        Time
       </b>
       node in the GerstnerWaveCum Material Function.
For buoyancy, the Gerstner equations are evaluated also in Blueprint, using the time from the
       <b>
        Get Game Time in Seconds
       </b>
       Blueprint node. When the game is running, this node outputs the same time as the
       <b>
        Time
       </b>
       material node, so water motion and buoyancy are synchronized.
      </p>
      <p>
       To replicate the water motion, we need to make sure that all clients use the same Time value in the GerstnerWaveCum Material Function. To make this happen, the GerstnerWaveCum Material function contains a Material Parameter
       <b>
        TimeOffset
       </b>
       (that defaults to 0) which is added to the output of the
       <b>
        Time
       </b>
       node. When the game starts, you need to calculate the offset between server time and client time and write the difference to the Material Parameter TimeOffset (in the Material Parameter Collection
       <b>
        WaveParameters
       </b>
       ). From time to time you should recalculate the time offset and update the TimeOffset parameter, to make sure that there is no time drift.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you use Buoyancy, a good strategy is to calculate the motion of floating objects on the server, this way it is ensured that the motion is identical on all clients.

       Currently Physical Water Surface is developed in 4.10 and has been tested successfully with versions 4.10 to 4.19. If you are using 4.14 or higher, please make sure to read the information about Temporal AA below. If your water plane is gray after updating to 4.17 you can read below how to fix it.

      </h5>
      <p>
       If you have fine detail on the water surface, for example a fine normal map or a foam texture, FXAA tends to look better than Temporal AA. For this reason, most of my demo videos were created using FXAA. If you want to use Temporal AA, you should set

If you are using an engine version between 4.10 and 4.13, you will find that FXAA is enabled in the
       <b>
        PostProcessVolume
       </b>
       that comes with the demo maps. If you are using 4.14 or higher, you need to manually select FXAA under

        PostProcessVolume

        Update Wave Parameters

       node. After compiling and saving this Blueprint, the water will be visible again. It seems that there is a bug in 4.17 that changes the default value from True to False, and adding the Make Literal Bool node fixes that.

       </span>
      </h5>
      <p>
       The water equations are implemented under the assumption that one Unreal Unit (UU) is equal to one centimeter. If the objects in your game have a different scale, the size and speed of the waves will not be correct. You can't just scale the water plane because the shape of the waves is determined by equations, independent of the object scaling. In fact, the Infinite Ocean System (if enabled) is constantly scaling the water plane up and down depending on the camera height.

      </p>
      <p>
       In my tests, one Volume Lighting Sample inside a small Lightmass Importance Volume caused incorrect lighting. When I increased the size of the volume so that multiple samples appeared the lighting was correct. You don't need the Lightmass Importance Volume to cover the whole ocean because it will extrapolate the lighting outside of the volume.

      </h5>
      <p>
       This is known to happen when World Position Offset is used to move the vertices of an object outside of the object bounds. The problem is that for a flat water plane mesh, the engine assumes that the bounds have close to zero vertical thickness. When World Position Offset is used to create waves, the vertices are moved far outside the bounds, leading to visual artifacts in some cases.

       . For a completely flat plane, you will need to put in a very high value. For this reason, the water plane Static Mesh that is included has a single out of plane face so that the engine calculates a higher thickness for the Static Mesh. With this Static Mesh, setting the Bounds Scale value to 10 is sufficient to prevent any artifacts.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the demo maps that are included, this is all set up correctly and no visual artifacts should appear. If you create your own water plane Static Mesh, take care to set the Bounds Scale option to a high enough value. Enable the

      <p>
       The automatically created points in Auto Points Mode are always generated in a plane. This prevents the floating object from flipping upside down in most cases. However, sometimes you want an object to rotate freely, for example a floating box that is smashed around by the waves. In the new Manual Points Buoyancy mode you can define the coordinates of the points that are used for the buoyancy calculation yourself. You can set the values in the Details panel, or from another Blueprint.

        Improvement of WaterHeight, WaterLocation and WaterSpeed Blueprints
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The three Blueprints WaterHeight, WaterLocation and WaterSpeed (that demonstrate how to query the position and speed of the water surface) have been improved. Now, these Blueprints also detect the Z coordinate of the water surface and are always displayed correctly on the water surface.

        Water Plane Collision Settings
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The collision settings of the WaterPlane Blueprint have been adjusted. Collision responses are now disabled for everything except Vehicle (otherwise Nav Mesh doesn't build on the water surface). This prevents problems in some cases, for example when a ThirdPersonCharacter was placed in the map the old collision setting caused problems.
