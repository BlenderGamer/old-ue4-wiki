       This tutorial will show you how to create a character who will navigate along a path set by a spline.
      </p>
      <p>
       First, add a
       <b>
        Spline component
       </b>
       to your character.
      </p>
      <p>
       With your character selected in the world editor, you can edit a spline by clicking on and moving the points. Hold [
       <b>
        alt
       </b>
       ] while moving a point to create a new one.
      </p>
      <p>
       In your
       <b>
        Construction Script
       </b>
       , detach the
       <b>
        Spline
       </b>
       from your character with the
       <b>
        DetachFromComponent
       </b>
       node. This will keep the spline in place while your character moves around.
      </p>
      <p>
       Select your
       <b>
        Spline
       </b>
       and from the Details tab, tick the
       <b>
        Closed Loop
       </b>
       option to join up the start and end points.

         Simple Move to Location
        </a>
       </b>
       is the most basic way to drive your character.
      </p>
      <p>
       Get the
       <i>
        World
       </i>
       location of the spline at the current
       <i>
        Distance
       </i>
       , this will be the point that your character tries to reach next.
      </p>
      <p>
       Create a
       <i>
        custom event
       </i>
       to store this value in your
       <i>
        Target Location
       </i>
       variable, and to trigger the character to move.
      </p>
      <div class="center">
       <div class="floatnone">
        <img alt="Spline05.jpg" class="" height="291" src="../assets/simple-spline-based-character-patrolling/3.jpg" width="631"/>
       </div>
      </div>
      <p>
       You will need to start a
       <i>
        Looping
       </i>
       <b>
        <a class="external text" href="https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Gameplay/HowTo/UseTimers/Blueprints/" rel="nofollow">
         Timer
        </a>
       </b>
       to repeatedly call your new event. This can be done with the
       <b>
        BeginPlay
       </b>
       event if you want the character to begin patrolling immediately, or selectively done only when/if you want the behaviour to start.
      </p>
      <p>
       Storing the
       <b>
        Handle
       </b>
       as a variable allows us to easily pause/resume the timer when we want to toggle the patrolling (for example if they see the player and should chase them instead)
      </p>
      <div class="floatleft">
       <img alt="Spline06.jpg" class="" height="373" src="../assets/simple-spline-based-character-patrolling/4.jpg" width="999"/>
      </div>
      <p>
       When the
       <b>
        Timer
       </b>
       ticks,
       <i>
        Patrol Speed
       </i>
       is added to
       <i>
        Distance
       </i>
       to move it along the spline over time. If
       <i>
        Distance
       </i>
       becomes bigger than the length of the spline, they are subtracted from one another to bring
       <i>
        Distance
       </i>
       back into range.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that should do it.
      </p>
      <p>
       If your character doesn't move, make sure it and potential target points are within a
       <b>
        <a class="external text" href="https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Engine/AI/BehaviorTrees/QuickStart/2/" rel="nofollow">
         Navmesh
        </a>
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       If your character frequently stops, your
       <i>
        Patrol Speed
       </i>
       may be too low. Use a
       <b>
        Draw Debug Line
       </b>
       node to check where your
       <i>
        Target Location
       </i>
       is at each step. I use a value of ~150, but it will depend how fast your character moves.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you find your spline remains attached to the character, recompile/save the blueprint.
