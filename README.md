# Old UE4 Wiki

[Old UE4 Wiki](http://nerivec.github.io/old-ue4-wiki)

Cleaned up old UE4 wiki

A rough parsing of the old wiki data (see link below), allowing easy access in a presentable format until the "still relevant" information is migrated to the official documentation by Epic Games.
Ordered by category and alphabetically.
All links are in one page for quick search.

_All links to the wiki have been updated to these pages or removed depending on if they actually lead somewhere. Because automatic parsing is never perfect, some information may be missing here and there. If you find any, feel free to create a pull request._
_Many pages had duplicates, these are located inside `pages/duplicates` ([link](https://github.com/Nerivec/old-ue4-wiki/tree/master/pages/duplicates)), just in case._

_PS: if Epic Games wants to take ownership of the repository, just let me know._
